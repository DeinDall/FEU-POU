# FEU-POU
I've been talking to some people on the FEU discord, and we were all talking about how much we disliked many of things of Mang's FE8 PME. But it was then that I thought, what if FEU got together and just modded the hell of an FE8 rom with what ever was suggested (within reason, of course.)  Pretty much everything is open to be suggested (nothing impossible, please)  Keep in mind that I'm just a simple guy who can use nightmare and stuff. If we really want this to come to fruition, it will require assistance from several community members that are not me. (Please, I can't do much when I think about it).  When (or if) the rom is ever finished, it will be released for all to play, but it would be nice if we had some FEU community members play it for funsies.  I expect many memes involving this community, go nuts.  SINCE I DOUBT THIS WILL GET MANY SUGGESTIONS, SUBMIT AS MUCH AS YOU WANT, NO LIMITS (Unless I say otherwise for a person)
