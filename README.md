# FEU Community/Collaborative POE

(POE: Pick Our Edits)

I've been talking to some people on the FEU discord, and we were all talking about how much we disliked many of things of Mang's FE8 PME. But it was then that I thought, what if FEU got together and just modded the hell of an FE8 rom with what ever was suggested (within reason, of course).

You can suggest whatever you like as long as it remains non-offensive (Read: no Rape or Nazi jokes pls) and does not break gameplay completely (and nothing impossible, please).

~~Keep in mind that I'm just a simple guy who can use nightmare and stuff~~ Buildfiles ftw. If we really want this to come to fruition, it will require assistance from several community members that are not me (Please, I can't do much when I think about it).

When (or if) the rom is ever finished, it will be released for all to play (as a patch, not the ROM itself, *obviously*), but it would be nice if we had some FEU community members play it for funsies. 

I expect many memes involving this community, go nuts. There are no limits when it comes to how many suggestions one person can suggest (Unless someone goes really nuts, then we will most likely pick only some).

# Contribution Quick Guide
Although Github is very convenient, it can be confusing to new people. Here's a quick guide to submitting changes to the POE.

### Step 1 - Make A Github Account
Go to https://github.com/ and make an account, that should not be hard.

### Step 2 - Download & Install Github Desktop
Go to https://desktop.github.com/ and download and install Github Desktop. Link your Github account to Github Desktop.

### Step 3 - Fork the POE
Go to https://github.com/Kobazco/FEU-POU (That should be the page you are reading this on) and click the "Fork" button on the top right of the page.

### Step 4 - Open your fork in Desktop
On the page of your fork (and NOT this page pls, or else you won't be able to push any changes), click the big green "Clone Or Download" button on the right. Click on "Open in Desktop". If everything went right, you should be asked to choose a folder to clone to. Choose one. Then wait for all the files to Download.

### Step 5 - Make your edits
In your Github Desktop, right click on the repo name in the left dock and choose "Open in Explorer". Yup, you have the whole buildfile repo on your computer now. Put in a clean FE8 (U) rom in the folder and name it FE8.gba (It should be automatically ignored by git, so don't worry about uploading it by accident). Click make hack.cmd to build the project and you can make any change you want from there

### Step 6 - Commit, Sync and Pull Request
Once you are done with your changes, Commit your changes in Github Desktop and click the "Sync" button on the top right. Then you want to Click "Pull Request" to Request a change to the main repository. Name and Describe your changes to be nice and push. If everything went right, your pull request should be listed [here](https://github.com/Kobazco/FEU-POU/pulls), waiting for Kobazco's approval.

### Extra - Stay up to date
Lets say a few days have past and you want to add new changes to the project. But there is an issue: your fork is outdated! To make it up to date with the main repo, Open your repo in Github Desktop, Click "Compare" and choose Kobazco/master. If there were any changes to the original repository, you can now click the "Update from Kobazco/master" button to... well, "Update from Kobazco/master". Confirm and Sync. You are up to date ! you can now continue making changes and pull requests for the project.

Voil√†!
