	Entries take the form of (Growth max(exclusive), Palette index). For instance, if I wanted growths under 30 to be blue, the entry would be (30,2). Terminate the list with a 0. 
	Valid colors are 0 (white), 1 (grey), 2 (blueish-grey), 3 (yellow, default), and 4 (glowy-green used for capped stats). That's it. Sorry. If a growth is higher than the largest entry, it will use 3, the default index. If you want to use the Display Growths hack without any funky colors, just put BYTE 0 and leave it at that.
	MAKE SURE THE ENTRIES ARE SORTED BY GROWTH IN INCREASING ORDER!
