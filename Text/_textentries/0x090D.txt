[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x04][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Princess Tordo! This way! I can [.]
see no more of Hyrule's men.[.][A]
If we've made it this far, we've
surely earned a moment's rest.[A]
Please forgive my grabbing you
so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]brusquely earlier.[A][OpenMidRight]Please reply soon, Meth.[.][A]
If it weren't for you, I would never
be able to use those animations.[.][A]
You are the reason I'm going.[.]
You have my gratitude.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]And whoever that man was, he was
clearly after my project[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's my fault that you received[.]
such a grave wound.[.][A]
Allow me to treat it, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Your Highness, I can't allow an injury
like this to be an obstacle.[A]
We have more important matters to[.]
attend to. We must press on to Frelia.[A]
We must fulfill His Majesty's wishes.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wonder how my father fares alone in[.]
the castle. Do you think he's safe?[.][A]
And what of my brother on the Hyrule front?
We've heard nothing from him for days.[A][OpenMidLeft]King Fado and Prince Ephraim are
both valiant and brave men.[.][A]
I doubt even the might of the Hyrule[.]
Empire can hold them in check.[A]
More important to me, Your Highness, [.]
is that you look to your own safety.[A]
How sad the two of them would be if[.]
something were to happen to you.[A]
We must reach Frelia to ensure the
day of your happy reunion.[A][OpenRight]Yes, of course. You're right.[.][A]
Until I'm reunited with my father[.]
and brother, I must not despair.[A]
Come, Seth. Let us go.[A][X]
