[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x04][0x01][OpenMidLeft]Princess Tordo! This way! I can [.][NL]
see no more of Hyrule's men.[.][A][NL]
If we've made it this far, we've[NL]
surely earned a moment's rest.[A][NL]
Please forgive my grabbing you[NL]
so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]brusquely earlier.[A][OpenMidRight]Please reply soon, Meth.[.][A][NL]
If it weren't for you, I would never[NL]
be able to use those animations.[.][A][NL]
You are the reason I'm going.[.][NL]
You have my gratitude.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]And whoever that man was, he was[NL]
clearly after my project[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It's my fault that you received[.][NL]
such a grave wound.[.][A][NL]
Allow me to treat it, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Your Highness, I can't allow an injury[NL]
like this to be an obstacle.[A][NL]
We have more important matters to[.][NL]
attend to. We must press on to Frelia.[A][NL]
We must fulfill His Majesty's wishes.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I wonder how my father fares alone in[.][NL]
the castle. Do you think he's safe?[.][A][NL]
And what of my brother on the Hyrule front?[NL]
We've heard nothing from him for days.[A][OpenMidLeft]King Fado and Prince Ephraim are[NL]
both valiant and brave men.[.][A][NL]
I doubt even the might of the Hyrule[.][NL]
Empire can hold them in check.[A][NL]
More important to me, Your Highness, [.][NL]
is that you look to your own safety.[A][NL]
How sad the two of them would be if[.][NL]
something were to happen to you.[A][NL]
We must reach Frelia to ensure the[NL]
day of your happy reunion.[A][OpenRight]Yes, of course. You're right.[.][A][NL]
Until I'm reunited with my father[.][NL]
and brother, I must not despair.[A][NL]
Come, Seth. Let us go.[A][X]
