We've heard nothing from him for days.[A][OpenMidLeft]King Fado and Prince Ephraim are[NL]
both valiant and brave men.[.][A][NL]
I doubt even the might of the Hyrule[.][NL]

More important to me, Your Highness, [.][NL]
is that you look to your own safety.[A][NL]
How sad the two of them would be if[.][NL]
something were to happen to you.[A][NL]
We must reach Frelia to ensure the[NL]
