Well, this must be my lucky day.[A]
You're a dead man. The wench goes[.]

# 0x090A
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x42][0x01][OpenMidLeft]I am Gwonam, the Moonstone,[.]

see no more of Hyrule's men.[.][A]
If we've made it this far, we've
surely earned a moment's rest.[A]
Please forgive my grabbing you
so[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]brusquely earlier.[A][OpenMidRight]Please reply soon, Meth.[.][A]
If it weren't for you, I would never

You are the reason I'm going.[.]
You have my gratitude.[A][OpenMidRight][MoveRight][OpenRight]And whoever that man was, he was
clearly after my project[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
It's my fault that you received[.]
such a grave wound.[.][A]
Allow me to treat it, I[.][ToggleMouthMove]--[ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidLeft]Your Highness, I can't allow an injury
like this to be an obstacle.[A]
We have more important matters to[.]
attend to. We must press on to Frelia.[A]
We must fulfill His Majesty's wishes.[.][A][OpenRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
I wonder how my father fares alone in[.]
the castle. Do you think he's safe?[.][A]
And what of my brother on the Hyrule front?
We've heard nothing from him for days.[A][OpenMidLeft]King Fado and Prince Ephraim are
both valiant and brave men.[.][A]
I doubt even the might of the Hyrule[.]
Empire can hold them in check.[A]
More important to me, Your Highness, [.]
is that you look to your own safety.[A]
How sad the two of them would be if[.]
something were to happen to you.[A]
We must reach Frelia to ensure the
day of your happy reunion.[A][OpenRight]Yes, of course. You're right.[.][A]
Until I'm reunited with my father[.]

Come, Seth. Let us go.[A][X]

Stand back, Princess Eirika.[A][OpenLeft]It's all right, Seth.[.][A]

Oh, no[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]
I'm fine, Seth.[.][A][OpenMidLeft]But you look so pale[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight]I'm fine[ToggleMouthMove]... [ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[.][A]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]This is war, isn't it?[A]
It's not at all like the games I used[.]
to play with my brother or Lyon.[A]
I never thought[.][ToggleMouthMove]-- [.][ToggleMouthMove]I didn't
know it would be this[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]savage.[.][A]
Are words useless? Is strength
all that matters? It's so sad[.][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A]
Why would the Hyrule Empire do this?[.]
To what end would they start a war?[.][A][OpenMidLeft]Princess[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]Don't worry, Seth. I won't
give in to sorrow.[A]
Let's get moving.[.][A]
I'm not broken, and I won't stop
until I see Renais restored.[A]
I won't stop until I'm reunited[.]

twice[.][ToggleRed] in one turn.[.][A]

do [.][ToggleRed]14 points[.][ToggleRed] of damage.[.][A]
